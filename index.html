                "Discovery": "Pluto was discovered on February 18, 1930, by Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona.",
                "Classification": "In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Pluto as a 'dwarf planet' because it does not clear its orbit of other debris.",
                "Orbit": "Pluto's orbit is highly elliptical, taking it from 30 to 49 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. One AU is the distance from the Earth to the Sun.",
                "Size": "Pluto is only about 2,377 kilometers in diameter, making it about 18% the size of Earth and smaller than Earth's moon.",
                "Moons": "Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Charon, the largest, is so big relative to Pluto that they are sometimes considered a double dwarf planet system.",
                "Surface": "The surface of Pluto is composed of nitrogen ice, methane ice, and carbon monoxide ice. It has mountains, valleys, plains, and craters.",
                "Atmosphere": "Pluto has a thin atmosphere of nitrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide, which expands when it comes closer to the Sun and collapses as it moves away.",
                "Temperature": "Pluto's surface temperature can be as low as about -229 degrees Celsius (-380 degrees Fahrenheit), making it one of the coldest places in the solar system.",
                "Rotation": "Pluto has a rotation period of about 6.4 Earth days and it rotates in the opposite direction of most planets in the solar system, a retrograde rotation.",
                "New Horizons Mission": "In July 2015, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft made a historic flyby of Pluto, providing the most detailed images and data ever collected about the dwarf planet and its moons."
